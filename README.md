**Speech Recognition in Python**


This project demonstrates how to use Python to convert audio into text using the SpeechRecognition API. 
Speech recognition technology is essential for developing voice-controlled applications such as virtual assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri) and various other applications where voice input is required.

Features

Audio to Text Conversion: Utilizes the SpeechRecognition API to convert spoken words into written text.
Voice Command Handling: Integrate with virtual assistants to handle voice commands.
Language Support: Supports multiple languages and dialects for broad applicability.
Error Handling: Robust error handling to manage recognition errors and provide useful feedback.
